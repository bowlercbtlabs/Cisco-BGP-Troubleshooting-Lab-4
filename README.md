# Cisco BGP Troubleshooting - Lab 4

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- You have recently upgraded your network and have decided to run an Internal BGP (IBGP) connection from R1 to R3. You have decided to let one of your junior level network administrators configure the IBGP neighbor relationship. After a few hours you check the status with the network administrator who says that they are unable to get the IBGP neighbor relationship established.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 and R3 peer IBGP with each other.

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After you have restored the above task, your junior level network administrator says that he is unable to ping from R3â€™s loopback 0 IP address to the loopback 0 IP address on R2.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that network connectivity is restored.
- R3 should be able to ping with 100% success from source 183.3.3.3 to destination 174.24.0.1.
